# odin-landing-page
<h2>Creating an entire web page from a provided design.</h2>
<p><em>This is the second project I'll be going through for </em><a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>!</p>
<h3>Criteria Requirements:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Get the project as close as possible to the <a href="https://github.com/thejourneyville/odin-landing-page/blob/main/source-images/odin-project-landing-page-original-image.png">provided design</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>first impressions:</h3>
<p>This looks like a good flexbox exercise, and I'm excited to put to use the things I've learned thus far. If I have the chance I would also like to personalize the page. For example inserting actual images in the placeholders, and playing with the colors and fonts a bit too.</p>
